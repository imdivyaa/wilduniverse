in theand is native to the northern part of The global wild gharial population is estimated at 
fewer than 235 individuals, which are threatened by loss of riverine habitat, depletion of fish 
resources, and entanglement in fishing nets. As the population has declined drastically since the 
1930s, the gharial is listed as on the It once inhabited all the major river systems of the Indian 
subcontinent, from the in the west to in the east. Its distribution is now limited to only 2% of its

The gharial,also known as the gavial, and fish-eating crocodile is a crocodilian in 
the family Gavialidae, and is native to the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. Gharial is the longest of all living crocodilians found in the Indian Subcontinent. 
 This fish eating crocodile inhabited river systems of Son River,Mahanadi in Satkosia Gorge,
 Katarniaghat and Chambal River.The gharial is a ther moconformer and seeks to cool down during hot 
times and to warm up when ambient temperature is cool.Gharials bask daily in winter, foremost
in the mornings, and prefer sandy and moist beaches. They change their basking pattern with increasing 
daily temperatures, and start basking earlier in the mornings, move back into the river when it is hot,
and return to the beach later in the afternoon.Large groups of young, subadult and adult gharials
form in December and January to bask together. Adult males and females associate by mid February.
Young gharials hide and forage in shallow water. Gharials up to a body length of 120 cm (47 in) 
prefer a water level of 1-3 m (3.3-9.8 ft).
