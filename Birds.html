Name &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp : peafowl<br>
Kingdom&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp&nbsp: Animalia<br>
Phylum &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  : Chordata<br>
Class &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   :  Aves<br>
Order  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp:  Galliformes<br>
Family &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp : Phasianidae<br>
Subfamily &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp : Pavoninae<br>
Tribe &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp: Pavonini<br>
           &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The Indian peacock has
           iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly metallic blue and green, 
           but the green peacock has green and bronze body feathers. 
           In both species, females are a little smaller than males in terms of weight
          and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the "tail", 
          also known as a "train".The peacock train consists not of tail quill 
         feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked 
         with eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. Both sexes of all 
        species have a crest atop the head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, 
        brown, and green in her plumage. The female also displays her plumage to ward off 
       female competition or signal danger to her young.<br>
             &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspIn blue and green 
        peacocks, the male has a 90–130-cm (35–50-inch) body and 150-cm (60-inch) train 
        of tail feathers that are coloured a brilliant metallic green. This train is main
        ly formed of the bird’s upper tail coverts, which are enormously elongated. Each 
        feather is tipped with an iridescent eyespot that is ringed with blue and bronze. 
        In courtship displays, the cock elevates his tail, which lies under the train, 
        thus elevating the train and bringing it forward. At the climax of this display,
        the tail feathers are vibrated, giving the feathers of the train a shimmering 
        appearance and making a rustling sound.The blue peacock’s body feathers are 
        mostly metallic blue-green. The green peacock, with a train much like that of 
        the blue, has green and bronze body feathers. Hens of both species are green 
        and brown and are almost as big as the male but lack the train and the head 
        ornament. In the wild, both species live in open lowland forests, flocking by 
        day and roosting high in trees at night. During the breeding season, the male 
        forms a harem of two to five hens, each of which lays four to eight whitish eggs 
        in a depression in the ground. The eggs are incubated by the peahen until they
        hatch some 28 days later. The chicks have all of their feathers when they emerge
        from their eggs and are capable of flight roughly one week after hatching. Most 
        blue and green peafowl become sexually mature at age three. However, some male 
        blue peafowl have been known to breed as early as age two.
